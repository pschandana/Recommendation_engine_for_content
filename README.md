# Personalized Learning Path Generator📚🚀

This is a web application that generates a personalized learning path based on your educational background, skills, and goals. The app uses an AI model to create a customized plan and allows you to download it as a `.docx` file. It leverages the `python-dotenv` library for managing environment variables and keeps sensitive information (like API keys) safe from being exposed in the code.

## Features🌟
- Generates a customized learning path based on user input.
- Displays a timeline-style learning path.
- Allows users to download the learning path as a `.docx` file.
- Securely handles sensitive information like API keys using environment variables.

## Prerequisites⚙️

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x or later
- Streamlit
- Requests
- python-dotenv
- docx

# Setting Up the Environment 
# Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/dasaribhumika/learning-path-generator
cd learning-path-generator

# Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment 
Create virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment (Linux/Mac):
source venv/bin/activate

Activate virtual environment (Windows):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install Required Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Set up your environment variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.
Add the necessary API keys or environment variables in the .env file. For example:

API_KEY=your-api-key-here


# Step 5: Make sure your .gitignore file is properly set up to ignore the .env file
Add .env to the .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing your API key to GitHub:

.env

# Step 6: Run the Application
streamlit run app.py

## How It Works 🤖
**User Input:** The user provides their educational background, skills, and goals in the text areas on the web app.
**Generate Learning Path:** Upon clicking the "Generate Learning Path" button, the app processes the input using the AI model and generates a customized learning path.
**Download:** The learning path is displayed on the page, and the user can download it as a .docx file for further use.
